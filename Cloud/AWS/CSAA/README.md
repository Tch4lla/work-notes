# AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate

## Training Overview

I've had a lot of questions about my (personal) training plan for the AWS CSAA. I put this plan together for [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?f=live) after doing a 6-week preparation for and passing the [AWS Certified Developer Associate (CDA)](../CDA/README.md) exam.

I am always suggesting that people have a plan. Here's my plan:

1. Training: There's an awesome course I will use.
2. Hands-on: I have access to hands-on material.
3. Practice Tests
4. Take and Pass the Test

I plan to do these four things in order.

* The training should take an estimated 30-days.
* I am not completely sure how long the hands-on will take, but I will assume about 30-40 days.
* Then, I should have 30-days or so to run through the practice tests to get to the level I want.

### Training

I used this same instructor's course for the CDA Exam and loved it. The courses are about 400 sections (each, very small), allowing for quick updates as services change at AWS.

### Hands-On

I had a few co-workers recommend this course for the hands-on portions. So, unlike the CDA, I will have a much deeper understanding of the components of this certification.

### Practice Tests

I used this and one other set of practice tests for the CDA Exam and found this one to be just a bit better than the other. Given that, I will stick with the same company.

### Conclusion

The core to my plan, as I said, is to go through all the training (even the parts I already know), then complete the hands-on, then practice until I reach 95-percent every time I am taking the tests.

Then, and only then, will I sit for the test ... my notes (as I go through the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?f=live)) are below.
